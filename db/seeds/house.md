House is the most soulful genre. It's also the simplest, the oldest, the
warmest, and where electronic music is concerned, easily the most
human-sounding, making it the most popular, commanding the most
producers, artists, labels, DJs, fans, and subgenres. The whole of top40
pop music gets its hooks, gimmicks, lines and melodies from house music
(and vice versa). That is why it stands as the world's perennial party
music, and it will probably stay that way until the end of time. Or
until someone finds a more catchy beat than the 4/4 bassdrum.

Its antecedents include funk, soul, blues, jazz, disco, dub, and
sometimes even hip hop, but none of that is here because it isn't
electronic (unless specified specifically). Still, no genre is an
island, and it had to get its inspiration from somewhere. Like, say
someone banging a stick on the edge of a wooden box or something. The
music's really been around for 40 years (if you don't believe me, go
listen to the Jazz Crusaders), the drum machines just make things more
groove-centric. Which is a good thing, owing to the highly-convoluted
social phenomenon that was about to emerge from this thing.
